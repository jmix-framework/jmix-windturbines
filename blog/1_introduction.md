### 1. Introduction

While mobile applications for line-of-business (LOB) applications have the potential to significantly enhance internal business operations, their adoption for custom software solutions has been relatively limited, particularly among small and medium-sized businesses. Traditionally, the high investment costs associated with developing dedicated native apps have been a significant barrier, especially when supporting multiple platforms. This has made mobile browser applications a cost-effective alternative. They allow to serve the growing need to extend business processes directly to end-users in the field, making mobile solutions increasingly crucial for internal use.

Employees need tools that allow them to access live systems and perform their tasks in real-time. In the past, businesses often relied on interim solutions due to the lack of direct exposure to core or line-of-business systems. This often meant using unstructured data entry methods, which then required manual post-processing to integrate with the main business systems. Those processes are inefficient and prone to errors, as they do not allow for real-time interaction with the core systems.

There are numerous use cases for mobile applications in the business application context. These include field service workers, sales teams, and third-party partners who need access to the companies' systems. Mobile tools can also be vital for customers who require real-time interaction with company services. By providing such tools, companies can ensure that work is done more efficiently and accurately, improving overall productivity and communication.

Previously, Jmix was primarily optimized for desktop use. Although it was possible to create responsive mobile web app UIs using Vaadin / Jmix alone, it was not the common approach because mobile support was not a first-class citizen in Vaadin 8 / Jmix 1.x. Thus, creating mobile solutions normally required developing either a native app or a mobile web app using different technologies, such as JavaScript single-page applications (SPAs). Jmix was mainly used as a backend API in this scenario.

With the release of Jmix 2 and the transition to Vaadin 24, there has been significant improvement in responsive design and mobile application capabilities. Mobile support is now a key feature in Jmix, allowing the same fast delivery and cost-effective development for mobile web apps. This means businesses can now extend their core processes to field users more easily, allowing them to interact with systems directly and perform tasks efficiently.

With the widespread availability of mobile devices and data plans, utilizing mobile technology has become seamless and unobtrusive, making it easier for businesses to implement mobile solutions without significant barriers.

In this blog post, you'll learn how Jmix leverages these technologies, with an example project showcasing the implementation of a mobile application.
