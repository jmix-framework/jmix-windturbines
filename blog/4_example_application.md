### 4. Example Application: Jmix Wind Turbines

#### Overview and Purpose of the Application

The Jmix Wind Turbines application is designed as a Jmix example to demonstrate how to build a mobile application that
leverages the advantages of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and Vaadin. This example application is optimized for mobile
use, showcasing how business processes can be efficiently supported through mobile technology, integrating field workers
directly into the system and enhancing overall workflow.

#### Business Use Case

The business use case for the Jmix Wind Turbines application revolves around the maintenance and inspection of wind
turbines. Field technicians use the app to access critical information about the turbines, perform inspections, document
findings, and report on maintenance activities.

#### Key Functions and Features
