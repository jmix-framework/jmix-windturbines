### 3. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

In addressing the need for effective mobile solutions, one compelling approach is through Mobile Web Apps, specifically
leveraging the Progressive Web App (PWA) standard. PWAs have been around for several years and offer a cost-effective
solution for building mobile applications. Unlike traditional native apps, which require separate development for each
platform, PWAs are built using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This allows them to run on any device
with a web browser, significantly reducing development and maintenance costs.

**What are Progressive Web Apps?**

Progressive Web Apps are web applications that offer an app-like experience. They combine the efficiency and
cost-effectiveness of web applications in terms of distribution channels and development costs with the classic
advantages of native applications, such as push notifications and the ability to be installed on the user's home screen.
Here are some key characteristics of PWAs:

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: PWAs work on any device with a web browser, making them highly versatile.
- **Offline Functionality**: Thanks to service workers, PWAs can function offline or with poor network conditions,
  ensuring that business processes can continue seamlessly without delays.
- **Push Notifications**: PWAs can send push notifications to keep the communication flow efficient and ensure timely
  updates on critical business processes.
- **Installation**: Users can install PWAs on their devices directly from the browser, without needing to go through an
  app store. This is particularly beneficial for internal business apps, as it bypasses the complexities and delays
  associated with app store approvals.
- **Access to Device Features**: Modern JavaScript APIs allow PWAs to access device functionalities such as GPS, camera,
  and other sensors, providing a rich, native-like user experience.

For internal business applications, the traditional approach to distributing apps often involved using Mobile Device
Management (MDM) solutions. These MDM systems allowed companies to distribute their internal apps through proprietary
distribution channels, ensuring that only authorized devices could access them. However, this method requires all
devices to be managed by the company's MDM system, which is not feasible with the modern Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD)
approach. In a BYOD environment, companies do not control their employees' mobile devices, making it challenging to
enforce app distribution through internal app stores or public app stores securely.

This is where Mobile Web Apps, particularly PWAs, shine. They eliminate the need for app stores entirely, allowing
employees to access internal applications directly through their browsers. This flexibility is crucial in a BYOD world,
where ensuring seamless access without compromising security or usability is paramount. Moreover, PWAs can be updated
frequently and seamlessly, adding new features and improvements without requiring users to download updates manually.

**Why Use Mobile Web Apps with Jmix and Vaadin?**

While PWAs provide a robust framework for building mobile applications, leveraging them with Jmix and Vaadin brings
productivity to the next level for internal business apps. Vaadin, with its advanced capabilities in creating rich web
applications, underpins this functionality. Jmix, built on top of Vaadin, enhances the mobile web app development
process in several ways:
