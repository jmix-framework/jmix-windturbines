### Conclusion

Throughout this blog post, we have delved into how mobile applications can significantly improve internal business operations by offering real-time access, better communication, streamlined processes, and higher efficiency. The integration of mobile technology is essential for modern, dynamic work environments.

We began by highlighting the untapped potential of mobile applications for small and medium-sized businesses, primarily due to the high costs associated with native app development. The release of Jmix 2 and Vaadin 24 has revolutionized this space, providing robust mobile support and making the development of mobile business applications more accessible and cost-effective.

In discussing the importance of mobile applications in the business context, we explored various practical use cases such as expense reporting, mobile CRM, inventory management, technical support, and claims management. These examples demonstrated how mobile applications can enhance productivity, improve data accuracy, and facilitate seamless real-time interactions within business processes.

We then introduced Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) as a powerful solution for building cost-effective, cross-platform mobile applications. PWAs combine the benefits of web and native applications, offering features like offline functionality, push notifications, and device hardware access. The flexibility and ease of deployment make PWAs ideal for a BYOD environment, allowing businesses to implement mobile solutions without the complexities of traditional app distribution channels.

Our example application, Jmix Wind Turbines, served as a practical demonstration of how to build mobile-optimized business applications using Jmix and Vaadin. This application showcases how mobile technology can support field operations, enhance workflow efficiency, and reduce media breaks in business processes.

In the technical implementation section, we detailed how to enable PWA functionality in Jmix applications and optimize mobile data views using Vaadin's `VirtualList` and card layouts. We also introduced Jmix Fragments, which allow developers to create reusable components declaratively, enhancing the modularity and maintainability of the application.

We concluded with an example of customizing standard CRUD views using Jmix Studio, emphasizing the use of `TabSheet` layouts for a better user experience and custom CSS for a polished look. This approach ensures that the application is both functional and visually appealing, optimized for mobile and desktop users alike.

The advancements in Jmix 2 and Vaadin 24 enable businesses to develop mobile-optimized applications quickly and efficiently. These tools provide the foundation to extend core business processes to mobile devices, ensuring seamless and productive workflows.
